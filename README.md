# Snake
### [DEMO](https://snake.sninjo.com)
This is a easy game, and we can step by step to learn how to design a wonderful program.  

## 1.0
This version is single player version.  
We make it according to your own direct and original idea, and you will find that if you want to revision it to multiplayer version, it will difficult.

## 2.0
This version is multiplayer version, but it not completed yet.  
We add some Object Oriented Programming to this game, and maybe something will be clear and easy.  
Object Oriented Programming- Let us find the close variable and function to make a object, and your program will be more clear and reusable.

## 3.0
This version is also multiplayer version.  
We use React as the framework, and it include the software design pattern called MVC, actually the software design pattern of React is MVVM.  
MVC- This is one way to clean up our program. It can help us to separate frontend (data display and GUI) and backend (logical data and function that defines how to process data), and the program is more maintainability.
